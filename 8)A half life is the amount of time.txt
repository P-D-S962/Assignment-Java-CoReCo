8)A half life is the amount of time for 50% of a radioactive material to decay.

After 1 half life, 50% of a material will be left.
After 2 half lives, 25% of a material will be left.
After 3 half lives, 12.5% of a material will be left, etc.

Create a function which calculates 
a) the remaining mass of material and 
b) the number of years that it took for the material to decay. 

You will be given:
1) The mass of the material.
2) The time in years for a half life to elapse.
3) The number of half lives.








CODE:


public class RadioactiveDecay {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double initialMass = 100.0;
        double halfLifeYears = 5.0; 
        int numHalfLives = 3; 
        
        double remainingMass = calculateRemainingMass(initialMass, numHalfLives);
        double totalTime = calculateTotalTime(halfLifeYears, numHalfLives);
        
        System.out.println("Remaining mass after " + numHalfLives + " half-lives: " + remainingMass + " grams");
        System.out.println("Total time for " + numHalfLives + " half-lives: " + totalTime + " years");
    }


    public static double calculateRemainingMass(double initialMass, int numHalfLives) {
        return initialMass * Math.pow(0.5, numHalfLives);
    }

  
    public static double calculateTotalTime(double halfLifeYears, int numHalfLives) {
        return halfLifeYears * numHalfLives;
    }
}



Remaining mass after 3 half-lives: 12.5 grams
Total time for 3 half-lives: 15.0 years
